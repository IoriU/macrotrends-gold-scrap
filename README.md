# Gold Price Forecasting
This repository contains code and resources for a Gold Price Forecasting project. The goal of this project is to predict gold prices using machine learning techniques and provide insights into future trends.

## Overview
Gold is a valuable commodity with a highly dynamic price influenced by various economic and geopolitical factors. Forecasting its price accurately can be crucial for investors and stakeholders. This project explores the use of machine learning, specifically ARIMA and LSTM models implemented with TensorFlow, to predict gold prices.

## Key Features
Web Scraping: We employ Selenium and PyAutoGUI to scrape real-time gold price data from dynamic websites, ensuring that our models are trained on the most up-to-date information.

ARIMA Model: We implement the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model, a time series forecasting method, to capture the underlying patterns and trends in gold prices.

LSTM Model: Leveraging Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a type of recurrent neural network, we build a deep learning model capable of learning complex temporal dependencies in gold price data.
